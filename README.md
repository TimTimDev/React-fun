**React.js learning material**
This repository is meant to quickly go through a few basic practices for setting up and working in the React environment and is mostly for my own fun.
For further details on React, please read the [React.js website documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

**Getting started**

*Prerequisites
Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine

*Creating your app
To create your React app easily and without much headache, run the following commands in the terminal you are working with:

`
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
`

PS: Note that `my-app` in the command line is the name of your app and can be anything you want it to be, not just `my-app`.
